# Dantotsu | Latest Updates & Repository Info

We all know the [original Dantotsu GitHub repository](https://github.com/rebelonion/dantotsu) was DMCA’d — but does that mean it’s the end of Dantotsu? **Absolutely not.**  
Soon after the takedown, **Rebelonion** set up a new **self-hosted Forgejo instance**, ensuring the project remains online permanently and free from external takedowns.
